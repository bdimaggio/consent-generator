{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Introduce yourself please. I'm olive glass. Hi, all, and welcome back. Wkyc.com. Hello. So today we are going to be shooting hogtied. lucky for you and me, I have to say me to this. I'm super lucky. we usually sit down and we talk about safe words, and we talk about what we're not going to do during the day."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "We're going to still talk about safe words. But instead of focusing on the things that you don't want to do today, I want to focus on the things that you want to like. So let's talk about some of the things that you're excited about haven't happened. Okay. So, give me your top three of the things that you're looking forward to today."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "rope. Okay. just like any cool ties would be really fun. That one, I don't know. The one flogger that has all the little sloppy bits. Little strings? Yes. What are those called again? It's a it's a flogger. I'm excited to use a flogger. And, I don't know, just, like, get into it and see. I always love you."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Always come up with really cool stuff to do. I feel like you've got a pretty endless imagination, and it's just fun to, like, get tied up and get into what we're doing. Yeah. Get a little drool going on that. I definitely enjoy. Yeah. one thing to remember, though, is a consent is remarkable. Meaning that even though you have a bunch of yeses and not a lot of nos, anything that you have said yes to, if you're doing something and suddenly you're like, you know what?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "It's not sexy. I don't like it. It's true. Whatever the fact, whatever reason, isn't as relevant as the fact that you don't want to just tell us we don't want to do anymore, we immediately stop, and then we go back and reshoot it in a way that no one sees you asking us to stop. Perfect. So it's. I tell everybody, kind of with a smile, to make it kind of take the edge off of it, as if you need us to fuck off, tell us to fuck off and we shall deal."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Same words. If you want everything to stop using red Uber guy drinking in your mouth. It's, both of those break character. Look into the lens if you're okay to stay in bondage and stay in character. But you want to get back off of what I'm doing is yellow or mercy. Okay. Let's see. Making sure that we have looked at talked about."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yep. Perfect. All right. So we have you back. Finally. I know it's been too long. It's been well over a year. so we had you here, and you said you're looking forward to this stuff. Of course. Orgasm would be fun, too. That I love those. Yeah. We're going to do all that. Is there. Do you get to do this a lot outside of work?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "No, I don't, I know. Well, it's partly because there's no like, studios. And then on my, in my private life, there's nobody that I'm, like, vetted enough to like, you know, have people be like, I'm Adam. And then it's like, no, you're not. So I haven't gotten to do it, which is why I'm so excited to be here today."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I love it. so I'm trying to think, like we've done so much over the years. I'm trying to think of, like, there's there's not. I can't pinpoint anything because I know we've done. We have done so much. We've done kink stuff. we've done artsy fun stuff. Where other. Yeah, the clown photoshoot. The clown stuff. You,"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "The ballerina thing. Oh, yeah. Is there anything that you can think of off the top of your head that you like? You know, we haven't done this, and I want to do this today or this. I mean, I can't really think of anything we haven't done that I would like to do, but, I definitely love, like, being a little stretchy with the ropes, like, some suspension elements is always fun."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "like, when we did the ballet thing, that was really cool. I don't have my ballet shoes, but I, you know, could still do something like that. yeah. Gosh, I'm racking my brain, and I can't think of anything that we haven't done that. I'm. Yeah. But we will stand with your flexibility. Yeah, that sounds great. honestly, when I was coming here, I was just like, I can't wait to be tied up."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "And I'm so. I was so hyperfocus on that, that I didn't really think of anything else. That's okay. My number one is I want to be set up for guys. Yeah. All day long. Let's see. your world worldly woman. You travel. I think you your favorite place to travel to. Or that you have to go."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I think my favorite place that I've ever traveled to is far barred. It's, an island just off of the Arctic above Norway. Okay. Yeah. For it. I would dog sledding there. And it's the Arctic. I felt like I was at the edge of the world. It was really neat. Dogs for two weeks through the Arctic. It's crazy."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I was, like, over -3Ohhhh and, yeah, stayed in a, couple of, like, little cabins. And they have to do two panes of glass on the windows and like, I was like asking, why are the front panes of glass is like on the outside were punched in and I guess when polar bears see their reflection, they just automatically punch."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "So they have to do two panes of glass. That was like it was cool. I reindeer jerky. And we owned we didn't have any electricity. That sounds terrifying. And I loved it. I love going to like extreme environments for vacation. The whole whether you were doing the dog sledding, how long each day, how many hours roughly were you guys?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "so it's February and we didn't have daylight for very long, so we would get up at 6 a.m. and go to about 3 p.m. and then stop for the night, because it would be like dark by then. And that's when it gets dangerous. If I wanted to go out to the bathroom and do like the outhouses, I would have to be escorted with, the guide and a rifle because of how prevalent the polar bear attacks had gotten."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Just wild. We'd see, like the dogs, big chunks of frozen reindeer meat. It was neat. I just like every time you and I see each other. And we talked, and there's always this, like we're the fucking out of left field. But it's like the best one. I love that we have. I think that's one of my favorites. But a lot of them."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I'm going to Romania soon to Dracula's castle. Oh, shit. The one with the lad, Vlad the Impaler. Vlad Draco? Yes. Yeah. That's. Yeah. One day I'll be. I'll leave this country and go and come and hang out in Romania. We'll go to, like, bring everybody. We'll go to Dracula's castle. Go all the time. He's a wealthy man to hell."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah. I've been to Rico once. That's about as worldly as a Puerto Rico scrape. They're in Wisconsin. That was so good. Wisconsin's got good teeth. Let's see. There's always benefits. Yeah. All right. Cool. Let's do it. Let's, We'll talk afterwards. Okay. Thank you. Bye."},

{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "This amazing ass. It's just been neglected. I'm not spanked enough. Turn around."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "The long with this part. Oh. That's the part where they give some attention to. Oh, give it to her. Yes. Oh. Oh. Oh. Okay. Don't stomp your feet."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh but you're stronger like your right leg or your left leg. Which one can I take away from you. Maybe see this one. Take your right leg. Yeah."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "See, I think it just melted. Oh. You did? Yeah. Oh, just one. One little beating. That's all the. Good."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "We're just getting started. And there's still more orgasms coming. Lots of orgasms."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "It's any stretch."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Just on."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "And that was all. It's okay. Like that. Since we get here and we've talked about it, there's no sense of just teasing. I'm giving you something. Oh, God. I'm nervous. Oh. Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh, fuck! Oh. Oh excuse me. We come so that you can come. Oh."},

{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. I'm still coming. Yeah. Oh. Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I just came so hard to make this into a suspension tie. Oh, that's what I was going to do anyway. So now that you've done the hard work for. Ha! Stand up a little bit. Okay. It's you. A little more."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Sensitive for these. Pretty sensitive. I might have the clamps on the other side. Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I'm actually. Going to put you in the air. We should make sure we're safe."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "It's really slippery."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "To do that sort of thing. Right? Yeah. Thank you."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "It's always when you're in ties that your nose starts. Every time. I think you got it in your."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "All right. Now we take the foot away. Actually we should. Okay. Should we hit your. Maybe a little more."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Ooh! Ooh! Oh, fuck! Oh!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Let's see what's."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Red. They are, And they're also amazing. Thank you. I haven't told you that today."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah. Now you're in the air."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Oh! Ha ha ha ha!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Ha ha!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh! Oh!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh! Like. Ha ha ha! Oh, this is very good. Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "We're coming in from the olives, please. Oh!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh my God! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh! Hi. Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Well, if you notice or not, I'll. To tell you."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Suck."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "So, olive. I'm trying to figure out a way to hurt you without leaving marks all over you. I'm sure you can think of ways. I have two ways."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "But there's the putting hurting you versus the healing part. It's messy because I like the hand part too. I'm gonna figure something out. I'll be. I'll be here. I'm not going anywhere. Good. You're going to be patient throughout this process."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "That's."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I feel like I should have a book and read you a story. As I sit here like this."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Because there's a lot of other things I feel like I should probably be doing if I'm sitting on top of you as well. You have nothing to do with reading books. I like a good story. So I can tell you a story."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "It's sexy. Very sexy. So we can just up. First of all."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "What an asshole. So intense."},

{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Yeah. It's a top layer of skin. It's a bitch. Yeah. Oh! Oh! Oh, fuck. Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "you're flexing his leg muscles, and I just letting go. I like, oh, it's hard when you tell me. No, you. Oh, Oh. I'm like, ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh! Oh! Oh!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh. like the, Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Yeah, like the last one got me once."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "You just can't stop coming here. Oh. That's okay."},

{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "She's a very nice is. Right."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Oh. I know there's some people out there that going to be love. Oh. Oh my. No! God! You wouldn't really think it. I want to make sure we're split around a little bit. Get in there where we want to. Oh. Oh. Okay. Hello? Oh, yes."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Oh. Oh, it's. Let's see. And so see what happens. I came in like space. Oh, look. Oh. Oh. That was a new kind of pain. Hey, would you like. That happened to me."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I have to say that making you come like this is definitely becoming my new favorite. Like, I literally sat there watching you from so much, I was like, oh, that's right. Just go standing there with the camera and there's other people in the room. I should probably do something besides just make you cry over, but know that that's how much fun I was having that I was just going to keep doing it."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I like it. But then I thought to myself oh. Just do this little thing since everyone's paying attention. And then when I'm finished with this thing I can go back to making you come and watch that happen."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "All right. With your booty up for me. Oh. Oh, don't flex your toes. I know, I'm so. I didn't realize how often I flex my toes until just now. Just. Just the session. Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Now that she's nice and sensitive. Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Oh. That. I think you can feel it now. Wait till I pull it. Remember that picture I showed you? Similar but different. But once I put the pressure on and I pull those off of your toes, then."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh, yeah. And then so long. Always the reward to the evil shit."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Ready for. Well, let's get you on the split. Not really putting pressure. I was, I. Oh. Now, the crazy thing. Oh. What? Oh! Ho! Oh! Oh! Oh! So, so what's this? Oh Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. I come to, No. Oh. I think the best part is knowing that you have to come. And then when you start to come as hard as you do, not realizing it and taking you by surprise. That's the hard part. Yeah. Ooh!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "No. Oh. What's the word? This is the one on one, tour. What's that? Oh! That was fun, right? Oh! Hey!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Jell-O."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. As much as I enjoy your friend and your beautiful face. And your amazing breast. I'm focused on the backside. Now I need you to lay your face back down like that. Just like that. So we can have access to all of this."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yes. Oh. Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh! Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh my God."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh my God! Oh! Oh. Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "oh. I. I just want to watch you grow more. Okay. Well, if you don't mind. And I like, take this."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh, you know, such tight, warm pussy. I feel like if there were enough room, it'd be the best place to go take a nap. Oh. I mean. Pussy. Rub it. There you go. You can play, too. Oh, fuck."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh, fuck! Oh! Oh! Oh!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh. That's going somewhere. Oh! Oh. It's good. Oh! I'm coming! Oh! Oh! Oh, don't run away. Lean into it. Oh! I think you should. I just just come? Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Hey! Oh! Oh! Oh!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh! Oh! Oh, fuck! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh, fuck! Ohhhh. Oh. Oh. Ohhhh. What, Oh. You okay? Oh. Please come. Oh Oh. Oh Keep going. Oh, no no no. Oh!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Oh! Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh. Can you run over for me over there? Oh, thank you anyway. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, we got another one for me. Give it to me. Oh! Oh! Oh. Ohhhh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow! Ow!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Do you know this little."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Oh. Oh, that is so sensitive. Oh my God. Oh, what you got out of the orgasm? Oh. Yeah. Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "This is the one. Ohhhh. Oh, yeah. Oh!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "See,"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "That was what I was looking for all day. Oh, my favorite one."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah, it's a little puddle. Oh, yeah. This little puddle. This nappy time. Now you're all done. And it's super, super sensitive. So if I ever reach back here and maybe do this, Just slow. Oh. Oh. is there one more in there? oh. Yeah. Ha ha ha ha ha! Do it!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Ohhhh, that. Oh the one, that's the one. Oh, I thought it was the last one, but that was the one. Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Hi, Olive. Hi. How are you feeling? So good. I, I agree with that. so that was a good. It was a really good shoot. I enjoyed that. and I have a lot more to. I have to say, I said off camera. I will say it on camera, get all bullshit, all character acting or whatever. Aside, that was a that last little just laying on you and kind of almost."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "That was awesome. Yeah. Because you were just. Just a little bit of wiggle below me and like, oh, this is almost as good a sex. yeah. I like the weight of it, too. It feels nice. Like it was hot. so we started off with a kind of we weren't super traditional as far as the way we do stuff today."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "We started with a suspension. Yeah. well, it's sort of a standing. Then we turn it into a suspension. Just happened to turn into a suspension. I was like, one leg up and we get to the pussy. Then you're like, wait a minute. Watch this. Now it's a suspension. Yeah. and then the second one toes. The toes."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh, yeah. The toes with the spread out. on the back. Yeah. And then this last one, the doggy style. what would you say if anything was the most challenging thing we did today? the most challenging. probably the first suspension. I was like. I felt like I haven't done suspension since the last time we did suspension."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "So it's been a long gap in between. And so it was it felt like I was doing it for the first time again, which was really interesting. But it was because, you know, when you're in suspension, you have to, like, be aware of your breathing, be aware of your movement, like be checking in with limbs and stuff. And so I was like, oh yeah, like like, oh, wow."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "and then the, I have never had anything between my toes like that. That was that was awesome. It was definitely painful, but, like, in the good way. Okay. Yeah, that that was hard. It was like a cute little feat that as I started to do it, as I kind of wanted to get this into the well, when you started doing it, I was like, I have these two toes that are like slightly webbed."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "And I was like, good lord, they're webbed up to the first knuckle. But then you just did like these. Yeah, I skipped the ride right passes. And, you know, it's like, oh, yeah, you know, we're asking really ignorant question. Does that help at all with swimming? I hope so. I don't know. I've been asked like before and I've actually I used to play mermaid when I was little, and I found out that I had that I was like, oh, like, oh, like I'm, I'm like part mermaid."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "there's a casino here in town on the south side, and they have a big, massive fish tank. And every hour or so that mermaid show, I should jump in and just be like, I'm supposed to be here. Have you seen my toes? This is where I belong. what was your favorite part? that last part where you were, like, over top of me, and I was coming."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "That was hot. Because I was like, alright, we're almost there. I think we got it. And then just girls kind of gave me a second. We need a couple more minutes. And I was like, all right. Worst case scenario, that's going to be like a rodeo. And you're going to put your best case scenario where you get one more orgasm."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah. That was the most intense orgasm too, because it was like, yeah, it was like the breaking point where I was like, I don't know if I can take any more. And then I went past that and I was like, okay, this is this is great. It was hot. Yeah. And you did. You didn't have a lot of wiggle, but you were wiggling enough that you were almost like a fucking bag."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah. I really like when I come so hard that I just start drooling, like, unintentionally. That means that it was the good, good time. Kiss with spit. Let's, You did it. We got a little marking on here. Yes, and there's a little bit up there on your arm that wrote Piggy's. How do you feel about those?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I'm fine with it. I mean, the ones on my titties, like, they're there, but they're like. I don't know if you can tell, but I can tell this one is already fading, like. Yeah, and this one will go away. There might be a little bruise there. I've got arnica. These ones will probably last, but like, honestly, whatever."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "It's fine though. It's going to be whatever they call it. there's a new style of tattoo. It's abstract. Yeah. It's like, neo tribalism or whatever they call it. It's like cool in the abstract. Okay, so all the women. So this little thing on my arm from that, that's tribalism. And then there's neo tribalism that looks a little bit more like like a metal band logo, you know."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah. Like sort of like that. Like the ones that you're like, how many fucking thorns and spikes? Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. do you feel safe today? Yes. Do you feel like at any point anything went too far? No. Would you go back to again? I hope I will soon, yeah. You were amazing. Thank you so much. Thank you."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Thank you. Bye."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Introduce yourselves please. Ladies first. Hi. I'm Octavia. Hi, Octavia. Red. Hi. I'm Tommy piss. I, I didn't know where it was going. I see where we're going with this. so. Tommy. Welcome back. Octavia. Welcome back. let's talk about, some of the things that are going to happen, all the technical stuff, and then we'll go into all the fun stuff."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Safe words. If you want anything to stop, you will say, Red, if you have his cock or anything else in your mouth to prevent you from speaking. You, both of those break character look directly into this lens. If you're okay to stay in bondage and stay in character, but you just want time to get back off of what he's doing."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Movies like Yellow or Mercy. So it's like a red light or a traffic light. Red stop. Yellow slows down. and as you were told earlier, normal verbiage works. So if you're like, fucking stop, motherfucker, we're not going to. Ha ha! You just say your safe word like we'll stop if we see something going on. We've looked you've seen the list of the things we're not doing."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I've seen the list. I have also seen the list. The crew has seen the list. Everyone is aware of what we are not. So, Octavia, let's talk about some of the things that you're excited about seeing. What are you looking forward to today? I am excited about the intensity of it. Just doing the general. Oh, you're so cool."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Okay. I know, I'm sorry. It's okay. I'll remember to give the sound guy more love. Oh, so tell me again, just to make sure. just really excited about the intensity of today, and. Okay. Doing another pretty awesome shoot. So we are going to be doing some CNC today, which is for everyone at home that may not know it's consensual non consent."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "There's another word people like to use. And we're not going to say that starts with an R and ends with a Y. And that's all we're going to say. So that's what we're going to do today. you guys know the story. You know the kind of fun stuff we're going to do. The power of change. Are you guys excited about this?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yay! Awesome. if we happen to get to a point in the story, Octavia, where tears show up from you. If Tommy cries when I'm worried about it. Yeah, but if you, for whatever reason, tears start to roll down your face, that doesn't mean they. We're going to stop. You have a safe word. And if you trust us."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "No. If we trust you. I always say this from. Basically, if you need us to stop, you'll use your safe word. And we're not going to stop unless we. If someone on set is empowered to step up on your behalf to go, hey, this looks like it's getting a little intense. I want to see something, but we're not going to just stop because it's like, oh, it's a tier."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Like, if you especially if you're into it, if it's hot to you. But clearly if you say, hey, you fucker stopped and when to stop. So good. Yes. Awesome. All right, so you two have done this dance before for this website for sexual submission specifically did. Here we are again. Doing it all over again. is there anything that you're that you want to try, Octavia, that you want to try this time that you weren't able to do last time?"},

And when you do that, is that when you're collecting the money that's contributed to the millions that you've been making? Is that how you collect your payment? My payment?

{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I guess you look good. Great. All right. Good. Yeah. That was really. Octavia, let's talk about the things that happened today. You played a Air Force victim. big drug lords, criminal mastermind, whatever we want. Yes. what do you think of the whole set up story? do you like it? I liked it, it was fun."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "It was easy to get my character and to keep it. Did you did you also give us tears in that first part? Almost. I heard the voice crack and the eyes water up and I'm like, oh my God, it's going to happen. All going tears in the first part before you even touches her. I was crying and then they like, went into hiding."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "It was perfect. You scared them away. No, not coming out. so we had you the kind of the rough, the man, the the. I don't know if you would call the mind fuckery in the first scene where it was more of like, you're going to do what you fucking told, and kind of more of the controlling through domination versus bondage."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "And then we had the two or bondage positions. we didn't do a lot of air. Quote, Bdsm activities, except for the storytelling and the domination through what we did is bondage. But with that said, tell me, did you find anything overly challenging today? And if so, what was it? Not horribly. Not really. I mean no I was really fun."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Okay. That's great thing too challenging part of the day. Oh favorite part other than goofing around with you guys do you. I thought it was fun when my feet were tired and you were fucking my feet. That was really fun. That was a great profile. So let's just go ahead. This shot of you from me to the top of her head."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah. You were doing the opening like it was a great shot. Everything was being done and captured all at once. The beautiful. Yeah, yeah. and this vision. Right. What about you, sir? What was your favorite part, man? you got it. You got a nice vagina. Juices flowing. Springfield. yeah, I like it. I like your penis."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "have sex? No, really. I just everything today, all the positions are great. And, Yeah, you stayed in character, which was awesome. You didn't, like, leave and be like, fuck my God out of my nose like some crazy shit. I'm not sure that happened a lot. No, it's just, you know, it's it's one thing that started in this, like,"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "And then once you start, it's just like, give it everything, you know? people tend to without saying, hey, I need you to kind of stay in this victim role the whole day. People tell me, like, okay, I'm so scared. Please give me more. Your cock. And it happens like that. Whereas if you're like, hey, let's the way we did, let's talk about this and stay in character and be like, oh, I'm so afraid of."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah, you just did it. And it was perfect. Yeah, it was great. What? I think you did. You feel safe today? Absolutely. Yeah. Do you feel like at any point anything went too far? No. Let's go back to it again. Oh, yeah, I hope so. I hope I get to do the time. Yeah? Yeah, ours. We can do it here."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Just, Tie me up, both of you. Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Peace be with you for this. Peace be with you and also with you. Live long and prosper."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Introduce yourself please. Hi, I'm Katrina Cole. Hi, Katrina Cole, welcome back to Wkyc.com. Thank you. So today we are shooting hogtied. And clearly we are not in the dungeon. We are outside. We're at the ranch. for anybody who doesn't know, Wkyc.com bought a ranch off. But here we are. Anyway, let's talk about the things, that you're looking forward to."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I've seen what you don't want to do. It's very few and far between. let's talk about some of the stuff that you're excited about. What are you looking forward to today? I'm excited to try, some suspension for the first time. Okay. We've never. We've had you and a little bit of rope before. Just a touch of rope with that shoot that we did with Tommy Pistol."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "All right. full suspension. You know. Okay. Oh, that's right, we did a section submission. You were there? Yes. I am smashing that thing. That's right. Thomas. Okay, I forgot every time I said I. Thomas, I think I might have scarred him. It's Tommy. So today it's all about you. It's all about the bondage. It's all about the torture."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "and obviously, there's no penis involved today. Sorry. or maybe congratulations. Depends on the perspective you look at it. I enjoy the pain. so we're going to be going through different things. We're going to be testing you. We're going to be pushing you, obviously, as far as, you're comfortable with and not any further. If by some chance we do push further, that's what we would say for sure."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Red stops everything immediately, and we do check in if, anything's in your mouth and prevent you from speaking. both of those break character look directly into the lens. if you're okay to stay in bondage. But you want me to back off of what I'm doing as a yellow and mercy. That's within the limits with the safe words."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Praying. If we happen to get to a point where tears show up for whatever reason, that doesn't mean that I'm going to stop. you trust us to stop and use your safe word, so we trust you to use it when it's necessary. But with that being said, everyone on set is empowered to step up on your behalf if they see you like."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I want to get a check in just to make sure, but. But it seems like it's getting to be too much. So if they do interrupt, it's for your safety. It's not for them thinking they know better than you. Good, good. Sounds good. And remember, everything that you've said yes to you can say no to at any point."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "consent is 1Ohhhh% revocable. And, if you do decide something's changed and you're like, I don't wanna do this anymore, speak up immediately. We stop instantly. and then we'll go back and reshoot it in a way that no one sees you asking us to stop. Oh, cool. Awesome. That's all that stuff. That's the technical stuff. So we did the section submissions."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "You've been in some bondage before. you've been tortured. We did a device bondage shoot. And you're back. You're back? Are you happy? I'm stoked to be back. I'm really excited. I've been looking forward to it. is there a certain part of what you've discovered doing Bdsm that stands out that you look forward to the most?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Is it the bondage, the submission? Is it the pain? I like the pain. Okay. Yeah. I mean, do you sexualize it? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I guess so. Is it something that you've noticed in here or, like, in outside of porn that you kind of are, like, craving more or, you know, that you found that you're like, oh, that's a thing I didn't know I wanted."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "you know, I think it's something that I discovered a while ago in my sex life. Pre porn. Not to this extent, but, you know, I remember the first time a guy really slapped my ass and really went for it and kept going for it, cause I loved it so much. And, I remember I was like, oh, this is this is a thing for me."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "and so that's definitely something that I've continued to incorporate, at more mild levels throughout, my personal sex life. But since you've discovered, like, you know, ever since that, that the, the device bondage shoot, that's definitely I wanted that extra edge. I gaffs because we noticed that day, just when I've talked about it several times, we I think we awaken the slavery monster that looks on your face."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "And I've seen you on set several times that I had never seen that look before. Oh, you over there tied up until you calmed down a little bit. You were hot. We joked that there was only one other model, Victoria Box, and I would like you calm down. And then we untie you, because you look like you're going to focus all straight into your eyes during this dry, which is super hot."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah, I love that. is there anything that you found so far that you don't like that you're like, yeah, I'd rather stay away from that. whether it was a type of pain or a certain position, I guess the stinkier the something we discovered last time, I think I prefer that, like, study European to the stinky pain, but I wouldn't say that I'm averse to it."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "It's just more that you prefer. Thud. Yeah. That's fair. more of a preference, I guess. Okay. Nothing that I have, like, a complete aversion to. All right. And like I said, you have very few limits today, so we are going to experiment. it's kind of going to take on a different thing today because obviously with device bondage it's steel and it's in a studio."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "This is going to be a little more organic because we're going to move around in a couple places. If ropes or rope is, has you been in rope. You know what kind of moves. It's got a little more to it. and we're just going to see some of it maybe heavy bondage with a little bit of smack."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "And I mean, there have been times if the bondage is intense enough, I'll walk in, put a vibrator on you just to get you through the scene, because that's like, this is what she's going to need to do this. and then if it's the bondage is lighter, we're going to fucking stop them and get some pain going."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "It's all good. Yeah, it sounds great. Awesome. you work out? Yes, I do. How did you work out? It depends a little bit on my shoot schedule, but I try to work out at least, like, four times a week. Okay. I try to sort of work it in if I am shooting a lot of work in little snack size workouts where I can."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I only ask if you're, like, super smokin hot, and every time I see you, I'm like, how do you keep getting hotter? So that's why I was curious. so does that mean that you avoid, like, fun things like dessert or. No. God, no. I have a wicked sweet tooth. What's your favorite thing? Milk duds. I love that."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh, really? I mean, there are a lot of sweets that I love. Ice cream. Way up there. You don't discriminate. You're like, no, I want. Yeah. Fair. what's your favorite flavor of ice cream? Black raspberry. That is good. Yeah. And actually, one last night like that, we should go have ice cream. All right. Ready to get started?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah. Sounds good. You got any questions? No. Awesome. Have a good shoot. We'll talk to you afterwards. Bye, guys."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Okay."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "So what part is. Is it the outside? Is it the being tied up? Is it the me having my hair? Is you what? It is me. This pussy that would that quickly. All of the above. So everybody sat around watching you while you're outside like this. so,"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "you know, that's is my favorite part. It's body spray. It's, you know, it's doing. Oh right there. Yeah. I don't mind doing this now. I'm right back there. Yeah. one more twist in order. No, it's a new house. just have a good morning. Oh. Right there. That's the spot."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Head forward."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "There."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "A little more helplessness. Time to make a move,"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Ohhhh. oh. Put your pussy up. Ohhhh. And spread on the time apart. Ohhhh. oh. See now. Oh, I'm sure it's not going to surprise you at all in this pussy sweater. That was."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I'll let you know. I thought your pussy was running down your legs. So you not get super excited."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "In this one."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "That's. Why. Should we just take your other leg up? And they're nasty things when you come out here in front of everybody."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "You know, we're going to take this leg. And if this sucks, you're gonna let me know. Yes. Give it to me. I was a sustainable happy to make you come like this. Okay? Come. You think so?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "There. Oh my goodness. It just so I hurt you more. So I make you come. Do I make you come and then hurt you more. And then make you come again? I see that smile. Maybe that's what you start with."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Let's start with give me a of that. Spit it up."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "You know. Oh. Oh. Perfume. Ohhhh oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "oh yeah. Oh What are you clenching a slut? Are you going to come for? oh. Come then. oh. Oh oh oh. well. Whoop! Oh, you were so close. oh oh oh"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh what The orgasm. Come here. You still getting close? Did you see what in your clothes? Well, Do it! Ohhhh. oh. Yeah. I guess oh."},

{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Is it all of it again?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "You put that vibrator on there, makes you come again. You want to come for me one more time,"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Ow! Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow! Ooh ooh. Oh! Let me distract you. I'm not gonna make you come faster than we can. Come faster. Oh, I am. Oh!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "oh some. Oh, that's the oh"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Ohhhh, you were so close, Didn't."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh, oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "oh oh"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Let's look."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "oh. Whoa! Oh! Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo! Oh! What happened? Oh! I realized. Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. So, So, could you imagine someone just walking on sliding right in there? Oh, yeah. Oh. oh. Oh, there it, Stick your tongue out,"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Okay. Oh"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "yeah."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "It looks like you're enjoying yourself. You comfortable? Ish ish ish."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "As I'm sitting there staring at you, it's gonna help you look at what could I have done different? I thought to myself I would have just. Spread the legs or. That could have been fun. So I'm gonna spread the legs."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "And see what happens."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Because once I start making you come, I don't want you to try and stop me. Even though I don't really think you're the kind of girl that will never know. Though."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Secretary. And I think your body and my rope make a good team. Yeah. So what? I think."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah. Now there's the test part to see if it actually holds with bamboo. It's hard sometimes to make things not slip. And the best way to test this? Well, just to do. foot on the right one. oh. You can't close your legs, can you? Two? Oh, look at you. Feel the wind pieces for. Oh!"},

{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh, you."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh! We're, Hi, Katrina. Hello. How are you feeling? Good. That was hot. It felt hot. Super fucking. I do think I am now a fan of being outside more. Because at first I was like, okay, it's outside, it's whatever. But now that's outside and there's random people that we're moving around through the whole thing. That was pretty fucking hot."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah. I actually really enjoyed that element. it was kind of nice. It was? Yeah. People were possibly watching us or were intentionally watching us. That was pretty hot. Yeah. I mean, it's like you always watch us, but, so we started off, in a basic standing position and turned it into a suspension. Then we put you in kind of a predicament."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Tie for the second one. Just kind of had your pelvis set up bridged, I think, is what they call it. Yeah. and then the last one, we just had kind of a basic doggy because you got a phenomenal everything, but we didn't want to not show your ass off. So we did that. what would you say out of the day, if anything?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "What was the most challenging thing we did today? The most challenging. I knew you were going to ask this, and I was trying to think what it would be."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "None of it. And I'm a little undecided. Okay. you know, there are definitely some, Excuse me. got sick on my throat. gosh, I can't I can't decide. What are they? What are they between? just like General, Like the impact. at times, like, kind of get right up on the. Yeah, right up on the edge."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "And forever, it felt like, I felt a little bit more intense than I had previously felt with that kind of play. just whatever my body felt like today. and then also, I guess the suspension was now. So that was definitely. Just exploring those new sensations, I guess. but the suspension and then the nipple stuff."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "My nipples were. I know, and you you went for. No, you went for it. That's a no no, I definitely did not say no, I enjoyed that. It was nice. But I do you also I, I'm very I feel like I'm a big cat when it comes to like kneading into the flesh. I loved that when you kind of pressed back and started almost purring, I was like, oh, I did like minded person here."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "the suspension for starters. I don't wanna go too far from that. First, that was your first suspension? That was. That was wrist and legs. That was it. That's not like the easiest thing for people to just jump into, especially for a first time in the air. Yeah. Not to be like a champ. I enjoyed it. Yeah. For sure."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "This means we got to do this again so we can experiment more stuff. I hope so. what would you say was your favorite part? Favorite part? You got my mind going. I when you pulled on my skin, I love that. the like. Oh, yeah. That felt amazing. What? that bridge position. yeah, the second one."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "everything about that felt amazing. The way the, like, rope, like, interacted with my body, the fingering, everything just felt so good. Yeah, I still got it. it was hot. Dude, it was everything about it. I was the same way. There was a whole lot of things going on everywhere. I was just like, fuck, this is really fucking hot."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah, and for the record, because I don't know that everyone because they they watch on monitor, they see you on the screen that sometimes it doesn't, they can't tell. You're not the shortest person. No. I mean it's like, I don't know, you can we can we can tell real quick. I want to see the. Can you cross your legs again?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah. Just so you guys can see like that's how little that box is going to take you. Hey, what happened to you? I'm a five, nine, five, ten, five, nine, five, ten. And put your entire body from basically head to toe pinched on that little box was a lot. Yeah, that was hot. Hot. did you feel safe today?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Absolutely. Did you feel like at any point anything went too far? No. Would you come back and do it again? Absolutely. You were amazing. Thank you so much. Thank you. Bye. Bye, guys."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Introduce yourselves please. Ladies first. Hi. I'm Octavia. Hi, Octavia. Red. Hi. I'm Tommy piss. I, I didn't know where it was going.

I want to see something, but we're not going to just stop because it's like, oh, it's a tier."},

{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "But I do like doing that fighting back aspect to combat and then turning into that, that kind of power exchange between you. You can't do this. But okay, maybe just a little. Yeah. That. Yeah, that's what to me, that's a fun game. I'm thinking yeah I like yeah. So when you are doing sex and bondage, well, just in sex in general, do you do a lot of this in your personal life or is this more just for the camera?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I would like to do more of my personal life, but so far it's mostly just been on camera and a little bit in personal life. Okay. Do you do you feel that the bondage, like, makes the sex better or is it just a fun little thing throw in from time to time? I think it does make it better."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah. Oh, shoot. yeah, I usually I like to keep a weighted blanket on me. I have sex just so it's like. Yeah, you wouldn't believe. Neither am I.

Yes. if anything arises throughout today, please feel free to ask as much as you need to, Octavia, as a reminder, and I will remind you throughout the day, consent is revocable. That means anything that you have said yes to you can say no to for no fucking reason at all."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "If suddenly Tommy starts kissing you, you're like, you know what? I'm not going to be kissed. Say something. I don't like the idea that you have to put up with something or tolerate something just for a scene. If you don't want to do it, just say so and won't do it. Not only will we stop, but then we'll go back and reshoot it in a way that no one will actually see you asking us to stop, and hopefully that empowers you enough to tell us to fuck off as needed."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Some good. Awesome. With that I say, great, you guys. I'll talk to you afterwards. Tell him I bye."},

And when you do that, is that when you're collecting the money that's contributed to the millions that you've been making? Is that how you collect your payment? My payment?

So. Right? Yeah. Right. And speaking of a mill that's also contributed to what you've earned over this year, correct? Yeah. Why? What have you heard? You know, I keep asking you not talk about, you know, certain things because you ask me, I agree to this interview because you said you'd be respectful, right?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah. these are just questions. These are questions you're asking these. You asked the same fucking question three times. And that's where it's getting really fucking annoying, because I feel like you're putting me on the spot. Like you want me to confess to something. No, no.

Under the impression that they're going to sit across from me and ask me questions, and they're going to be fucking respectful and not, then you put me in a situation that I didn't mean any disrespect by what you did."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "You had every intention to disrespect me to get the scoop that it I mean, that's my job. That's your job. I'm really apologetic. I, I don't want a fucking apology.

{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "It was easy to get my character and to keep it. Did you did you also give us tears in that first part? Almost. I heard the voice crack and the eyes water up and I'm like, oh my God, it's going to happen. All going tears in the first part before you even touches her. I was crying and then they like, went into hiding."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "It was perfect. You scared them away. No, not coming out. so we had you the kind of the rough, the man, the the. I don't know if you would call the mind fuckery in the first scene where it was more of like, you're going to do what you fucking told, and kind of more of the controlling through domination versus bondage."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "And then we had the two or bondage positions. we didn't do a lot of air. Quote, Bdsm activities, except for the storytelling and the domination through what we did is bondage. But with that said, tell me, did you find anything overly challenging today? And if so, what was it? Not horribly. Not really. I mean no I was really fun."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Okay. That's great thing too challenging part of the day. Oh favorite part other than goofing around with you guys do you.

So today we are going to be shooting hogtied. lucky for you and me, I have to say me to this. I'm super lucky. we usually sit down and we talk about safe words, and we talk about what we're not going to do during the day."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "We're going to still talk about safe words. But instead of focusing on the things that you don't want to do today, I want to focus on the things that you want to like. So let's talk about some of the things that you're excited about haven't happened. Okay. So, give me your top three of the things that you're looking forward to today."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "rope. Okay. just like any cool ties would be really fun. That one, I don't know. The one flogger that has all the little sloppy bits. Little strings? Yes. What are those called again? It's a it's a flogger. I'm excited to use a flogger. And, I don't know, just, like, get into it and see. I always love you."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Always come up with really cool stuff to do. I feel like you've got a pretty endless imagination, and it's just fun to, like, get tied up and get into what we're doing. Yeah. Get a little drool going on that. I definitely enjoy. Yeah. one thing to remember, though, is a consent is remarkable. Meaning that even though you have a bunch of yeses and not a lot of nos, anything that you have said yes to, if you're doing something and suddenly you're like, you know what?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "It's not sexy. I don't like it. It's true. Whatever the fact, whatever reason, isn't as relevant as the fact that you don't want to just tell us we don't want to do anymore, we immediately stop, and then we go back and reshoot it in a way that no one sees you asking us to stop. Perfect. So it's. I tell everybody, kind of with a smile, to make it kind of take the edge off of it, as if you need us to fuck off, tell us to fuck off and we shall deal."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Same words. If you want everything to stop using red Uber guy drinking in your mouth. It's, both of those break character. Look into the lens if you're okay to stay in bondage and stay in character. But you want to get back off of what I'm doing is yellow or mercy. Okay. Let's see. Making sure that we have looked at talked about."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yep. Perfect. All right. So we have you back. Finally. I know it's been too long. It's been well over a year. so we had you here, and you said you're looking forward to this stuff. Of course. Orgasm would be fun, too. That I love those. Yeah. We're going to do all that. Is there. Do you get to do this a lot outside of work?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "No, I don't, I know. Well, it's partly because there's no like, studios. And then on my, in my private life, there's nobody that I'm, like, vetted enough to like, you know, have people be like, I'm Adam. And then it's like, no, you're not. So I haven't gotten to do it, which is why I'm so excited to be here today."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I love it. so I'm trying to think, like we've done so much over the years. I'm trying to think of, like, there's there's not. I can't pinpoint anything because I know we've done. We have done so much. We've done kink stuff. we've done artsy fun stuff. Where other. Yeah, the clown photoshoot. The clown stuff. You,"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "The ballerina thing. Oh, yeah. Is there anything that you can think of off the top of your head that you like? You know, we haven't done this, and I want to do this today or this. I mean, I can't really think of anything we haven't done that I would like to do, but, I definitely love, like, being a little stretchy with the ropes, like, some suspension elements is always fun."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "like, when we did the ballet thing, that was really cool. I don't have my ballet shoes, but I, you know, could still do something like that. yeah. Gosh, I'm racking my brain, and I can't think of anything that we haven't done that. I'm. Yeah. But we will stand with your flexibility. Yeah, that sounds great. honestly, when I was coming here, I was just like, I can't wait to be tied up."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "And I'm so. I was so hyperfocus on that, that I didn't really think of anything else. That's okay. My number one is I want to be set up for guys. Yeah. All day long. Let's see. your world worldly woman. You travel. I think you your favorite place to travel to. Or that you have to go."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I think my favorite place that I've ever traveled to is far barred. It's, an island just off of the Arctic above Norway. Okay. Yeah. For it. I would dog sledding there. And it's the Arctic. I felt like I was at the edge of the world. It was really neat. Dogs for two weeks through the Arctic. It's crazy."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I was, like, over -3Ohhhh and, yeah, stayed in a, couple of, like, little cabins. And they have to do two panes of glass on the windows and like, I was like asking, why are the front panes of glass is like on the outside were punched in and I guess when polar bears see their reflection, they just automatically punch."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "So they have to do two panes of glass. That was like it was cool. I reindeer jerky. And we owned we didn't have any electricity. That sounds terrifying. And I loved it. I love going to like extreme environments for vacation. The whole whether you were doing the dog sledding, how long each day, how many hours roughly were you guys?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "so it's February and we didn't have daylight for very long, so we would get up at 6 a.m. and go to about 3 p.m. and then stop for the night, because it would be like dark by then. And that's when it gets dangerous. If I wanted to go out to the bathroom and do like the outhouses, I would have to be escorted with, the guide and a rifle because of how prevalent the polar bear attacks had gotten."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Just wild. We'd see, like the dogs, big chunks of frozen reindeer meat. It was neat. I just like every time you and I see each other. And we talked, and there's always this, like we're the fucking out of left field. But it's like the best one. I love that we have. I think that's one of my favorites. But a lot of them."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I'm going to Romania soon to Dracula's castle. Oh, shit. The one with the lad, Vlad the Impaler. Vlad Draco? Yes. Yeah. That's. Yeah. One day I'll be. I'll leave this country and go and come and hang out in Romania. We'll go to, like, bring everybody. We'll go to Dracula's castle. Go all the time. He's a wealthy man to hell."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah. I've been to Rico once. That's about as worldly as a Puerto Rico scrape. They're in Wisconsin. That was so good. Wisconsin's got good teeth. Let's see. There's always benefits. Yeah. All right. Cool. Let's do it. Let's, We'll talk afterwards. Okay. Thank you. Bye."},

{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "So, olive. I'm trying to figure out a way to hurt you without leaving marks all over you. I'm sure you can think of ways. I have two ways."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "But there's the putting hurting you versus the healing part. It's messy because I like the hand part too. I'm gonna figure something out. I'll be. I'll be here. I'm not going anywhere. Good. You're going to be patient throughout this process."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "That's."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I feel like I should have a book and read you a story. As I sit here like this."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Because there's a lot of other things I feel like I should probably be doing if I'm sitting on top of you as well. You have nothing to do with reading books. I like a good story. So I can tell you a story."},

{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I have to say that making you come like this is definitely becoming my new favorite. Like, I literally sat there watching you from so much, I was like, oh, that's right. Just go standing there with the camera and there's other people in the room. I should probably do something besides just make you cry over, but know that that's how much fun I was having that I was just going to keep doing it."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I like it. But then I thought to myself oh. Just do this little thing since everyone's paying attention. And then when I'm finished with this thing I can go back to making you come and watch that happen."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "All right. With your booty up for me. Oh. Oh, don't flex your toes. I know, I'm so. I didn't realize how often I flex my toes until just now. Just. Just the session. Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Now that she's nice and sensitive. Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Oh. That. I think you can feel it now. Wait till I pull it. Remember that picture I showed you? Similar but different. But once I put the pressure on and I pull those off of your toes, then."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh, yeah. And then so long. Always the reward to the evil shit."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Ready for. Well, let's get you on the split. Not really putting pressure. I was, I. Oh. Now, the crazy thing. Oh. What? Oh! Ho! Oh! Oh! Oh! So, so what's this? Oh Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. I come to, No. Oh. I think the best part is knowing that you have to come. And then when you start to come as hard as you do, not realizing it and taking you by surprise. That's the hard part. Yeah. Ooh!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "No. Oh. What's the word? This is the one on one, tour. What's that? Oh! That was fun, right? Oh! Hey!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Jell-O."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. As much as I enjoy your friend and your beautiful face. And your amazing breast. I'm focused on the backside. Now I need you to lay your face back down like that. Just like that. So we can have access to all of this."},

{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh, fuck! Oh! Oh! Oh!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh. That's going somewhere. Oh! Oh. It's good. Oh! I'm coming! Oh! Oh! Oh, don't run away. Lean into it. Oh! I think you should. I just just come? Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Hey! Oh! Oh! Oh!"},

{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah, it's a little puddle. Oh, yeah. This little puddle. This nappy time. Now you're all done. And it's super, super sensitive. So if I ever reach back here and maybe do this, Just slow. Oh. Oh. is there one more in there? oh. Yeah. Ha ha ha ha ha! Do it!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Ohhhh, that. Oh the one, that's the one. Oh, I thought it was the last one, but that was the one. Oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Hi, Olive. Hi. How are you feeling? So good. I, I agree with that. so that was a good. It was a really good shoot. I enjoyed that. and I have a lot more to. I have to say, I said off camera. I will say it on camera, get all bullshit, all character acting or whatever. Aside, that was a that last little just laying on you and kind of almost."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "That was awesome. Yeah. Because you were just. Just a little bit of wiggle below me and like, oh, this is almost as good a sex. yeah. I like the weight of it, too. It feels nice. Like it was hot. so we started off with a kind of we weren't super traditional as far as the way we do stuff today."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "We started with a suspension. Yeah. well, it's sort of a standing. Then we turn it into a suspension. Just happened to turn into a suspension. I was like, one leg up and we get to the pussy. Then you're like, wait a minute. Watch this. Now it's a suspension. Yeah. and then the second one toes. The toes."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh, yeah. The toes with the spread out. on the back. Yeah. And then this last one, the doggy style. what would you say if anything was the most challenging thing we did today? the most challenging. probably the first suspension. I was like. I felt like I haven't done suspension since the last time we did suspension."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "So it's been a long gap in between. And so it was it felt like I was doing it for the first time again, which was really interesting. But it was because, you know, when you're in suspension, you have to, like, be aware of your breathing, be aware of your movement, like be checking in with limbs and stuff. And so I was like, oh yeah, like like, oh, wow."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "and then the, I have never had anything between my toes like that. That was that was awesome. It was definitely painful, but, like, in the good way. Okay. Yeah, that that was hard. It was like a cute little feat that as I started to do it, as I kind of wanted to get this into the well, when you started doing it, I was like, I have these two toes that are like slightly webbed."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "And I was like, good lord, they're webbed up to the first knuckle. But then you just did like these. Yeah, I skipped the ride right passes. And, you know, it's like, oh, yeah, you know, we're asking really ignorant question. Does that help at all with swimming? I hope so. I don't know. I've been asked like before and I've actually I used to play mermaid when I was little, and I found out that I had that I was like, oh, like, oh, like I'm, I'm like part mermaid."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "there's a casino here in town on the south side, and they have a big, massive fish tank. And every hour or so that mermaid show, I should jump in and just be like, I'm supposed to be here. Have you seen my toes? This is where I belong. what was your favorite part? that last part where you were, like, over top of me, and I was coming."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "That was hot. Because I was like, alright, we're almost there. I think we got it. And then just girls kind of gave me a second. We need a couple more minutes. And I was like, all right. Worst case scenario, that's going to be like a rodeo. And you're going to put your best case scenario where you get one more orgasm."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah. That was the most intense orgasm too, because it was like, yeah, it was like the breaking point where I was like, I don't know if I can take any more. And then I went past that and I was like, okay, this is this is great. It was hot. Yeah. And you did. You didn't have a lot of wiggle, but you were wiggling enough that you were almost like a fucking bag."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah. I really like when I come so hard that I just start drooling, like, unintentionally. That means that it was the good, good time. Kiss with spit. Let's, You did it. We got a little marking on here. Yes, and there's a little bit up there on your arm that wrote Piggy's. How do you feel about those?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I'm fine with it. I mean, the ones on my titties, like, they're there, but they're like. I don't know if you can tell, but I can tell this one is already fading, like. Yeah, and this one will go away. There might be a little bruise there. I've got arnica. These ones will probably last, but like, honestly, whatever."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "It's fine though. It's going to be whatever they call it. there's a new style of tattoo. It's abstract. Yeah. It's like, neo tribalism or whatever they call it. It's like cool in the abstract. Okay, so all the women. So this little thing on my arm from that, that's tribalism. And then there's neo tribalism that looks a little bit more like like a metal band logo, you know."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah. Like sort of like that. Like the ones that you're like, how many fucking thorns and spikes? Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. do you feel safe today? Yes. Do you feel like at any point anything went too far? No. Would you go back to again? I hope I will soon, yeah. You were amazing. Thank you so much. Thank you."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Thank you. Bye."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Introduce yourself please. Hi, I'm Katrina Cole. Hi, Katrina Cole, welcome back to Wkyc.com. Thank you. So today we are shooting hogtied. And clearly we are not in the dungeon. We are outside. We're at the ranch. for anybody who doesn't know, Wkyc.com bought a ranch off. But here we are. Anyway, let's talk about the things, that you're looking forward to."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I've seen what you don't want to do. It's very few and far between. let's talk about some of the stuff that you're excited about. What are you looking forward to today? I'm excited to try, some suspension for the first time. Okay. We've never. We've had you and a little bit of rope before. Just a touch of rope with that shoot that we did with Tommy Pistol."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "All right. full suspension. You know. Okay. Oh, that's right, we did a section submission. You were there? Yes. I am smashing that thing. That's right. Thomas. Okay, I forgot every time I said I. Thomas, I think I might have scarred him. It's Tommy. So today it's all about you. It's all about the bondage. It's all about the torture."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "and obviously, there's no penis involved today. Sorry. or maybe congratulations. Depends on the perspective you look at it. I enjoy the pain. so we're going to be going through different things. We're going to be testing you. We're going to be pushing you, obviously, as far as, you're comfortable with and not any further. If by some chance we do push further, that's what we would say for sure."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Red stops everything immediately, and we do check in if, anything's in your mouth and prevent you from speaking. both of those break character look directly into the lens. if you're okay to stay in bondage. But you want me to back off of what I'm doing as a yellow and mercy. That's within the limits with the safe words."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Praying. If we happen to get to a point where tears show up for whatever reason, that doesn't mean that I'm going to stop. you trust us to stop and use your safe word, so we trust you to use it when it's necessary. But with that being said, everyone on set is empowered to step up on your behalf if they see you like."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I want to get a check in just to make sure, but. But it seems like it's getting to be too much. So if they do interrupt, it's for your safety. It's not for them thinking they know better than you. Good, good. Sounds good. And remember, everything that you've said yes to you can say no to at any point."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "consent is 1Ohhhh% revocable. And, if you do decide something's changed and you're like, I don't wanna do this anymore, speak up immediately. We stop instantly. and then we'll go back and reshoot it in a way that no one sees you asking us to stop. Oh, cool. Awesome. That's all that stuff. That's the technical stuff. So we did the section submissions."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "You've been in some bondage before. you've been tortured. We did a device bondage shoot. And you're back. You're back? Are you happy? I'm stoked to be back. I'm really excited. I've been looking forward to it. is there a certain part of what you've discovered doing Bdsm that stands out that you look forward to the most?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Is it the bondage, the submission? Is it the pain? I like the pain. Okay. Yeah. I mean, do you sexualize it? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I guess so. Is it something that you've noticed in here or, like, in outside of porn that you kind of are, like, craving more or, you know, that you found that you're like, oh, that's a thing I didn't know I wanted."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "you know, I think it's something that I discovered a while ago in my sex life. Pre porn. Not to this extent, but, you know, I remember the first time a guy really slapped my ass and really went for it and kept going for it, cause I loved it so much. And, I remember I was like, oh, this is this is a thing for me."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "and so that's definitely something that I've continued to incorporate, at more mild levels throughout, my personal sex life. But since you've discovered, like, you know, ever since that, that the, the device bondage shoot, that's definitely I wanted that extra edge. I gaffs because we noticed that day, just when I've talked about it several times, we I think we awaken the slavery monster that looks on your face."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "And I've seen you on set several times that I had never seen that look before. Oh, you over there tied up until you calmed down a little bit. You were hot. We joked that there was only one other model, Victoria Box, and I would like you calm down. And then we untie you, because you look like you're going to focus all straight into your eyes during this dry, which is super hot."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah, I love that. is there anything that you found so far that you don't like that you're like, yeah, I'd rather stay away from that. whether it was a type of pain or a certain position, I guess the stinkier the something we discovered last time, I think I prefer that, like, study European to the stinky pain, but I wouldn't say that I'm averse to it."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "It's just more that you prefer. Thud. Yeah. That's fair. more of a preference, I guess. Okay. Nothing that I have, like, a complete aversion to. All right. And like I said, you have very few limits today, so we are going to experiment. it's kind of going to take on a different thing today because obviously with device bondage it's steel and it's in a studio."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "This is going to be a little more organic because we're going to move around in a couple places. If ropes or rope is, has you been in rope. You know what kind of moves. It's got a little more to it. and we're just going to see some of it maybe heavy bondage with a little bit of smack."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "And I mean, there have been times if the bondage is intense enough, I'll walk in, put a vibrator on you just to get you through the scene, because that's like, this is what she's going to need to do this. and then if it's the bondage is lighter, we're going to fucking stop them and get some pain going."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "It's all good. Yeah, it sounds great. Awesome. you work out? Yes, I do. How did you work out? It depends a little bit on my shoot schedule, but I try to work out at least, like, four times a week. Okay. I try to sort of work it in if I am shooting a lot of work in little snack size workouts where I can."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I only ask if you're, like, super smokin hot, and every time I see you, I'm like, how do you keep getting hotter? So that's why I was curious. so does that mean that you avoid, like, fun things like dessert or. No. God, no. I have a wicked sweet tooth. What's your favorite thing? Milk duds. I love that."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh, really? I mean, there are a lot of sweets that I love. Ice cream. Way up there. You don't discriminate. You're like, no, I want. Yeah. Fair. what's your favorite flavor of ice cream? Black raspberry. That is good. Yeah. And actually, one last night like that, we should go have ice cream. All right. Ready to get started?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah. Sounds good. You got any questions? No. Awesome. Have a good shoot. We'll talk to you afterwards. Bye, guys."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Okay."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "So what part is. Is it the outside? Is it the being tied up? Is it the me having my hair? Is you what? It is me. This pussy that would that quickly. All of the above. So everybody sat around watching you while you're outside like this. so,"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "you know, that's is my favorite part. It's body spray. It's, you know, it's doing. Oh right there. Yeah. I don't mind doing this now. I'm right back there. Yeah. one more twist in order. No, it's a new house. just have a good morning. Oh. Right there. That's the spot."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Head forward."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "There."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "A little more helplessness. Time to make a move,"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Ohhhh. oh. Put your pussy up. Ohhhh. And spread on the time apart. Ohhhh. oh. See now. Oh, I'm sure it's not going to surprise you at all in this pussy sweater. That was."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "I'll let you know. I thought your pussy was running down your legs. So you not get super excited."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "In this one."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "That's. Why. Should we just take your other leg up? And they're nasty things when you come out here in front of everybody."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "You know, we're going to take this leg. And if this sucks, you're gonna let me know. Yes. Give it to me. I was a sustainable happy to make you come like this. Okay? Come. You think so?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "There. Oh my goodness. It just so I hurt you more. So I make you come. Do I make you come and then hurt you more. And then make you come again? I see that smile. Maybe that's what you start with."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Let's start with give me a of that. Spit it up."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "You know. Oh. Oh. Perfume. Ohhhh oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "oh yeah. Oh What are you clenching a slut? Are you going to come for? oh. Come then. oh. Oh oh oh. well. Whoop! Oh, you were so close. oh oh oh"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh what The orgasm. Come here. You still getting close? Did you see what in your clothes? Well, Do it! Ohhhh. oh. Yeah. I guess oh."},

{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Is it all of it again?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "You put that vibrator on there, makes you come again. You want to come for me one more time,"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Ow! Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow! Ooh ooh. Oh! Let me distract you. I'm not gonna make you come faster than we can. Come faster. Oh, I am. Oh!"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "oh some. Oh, that's the oh"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh. Ohhhh, you were so close, Didn't."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh, oh."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "oh oh"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Let's look."},

{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Okay. Oh"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "yeah."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "It looks like you're enjoying yourself. You comfortable? Ish ish ish."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "As I'm sitting there staring at you, it's gonna help you look at what could I have done different? I thought to myself I would have just. Spread the legs or. That could have been fun. So I'm gonna spread the legs."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "And see what happens."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Because once I start making you come, I don't want you to try and stop me. Even though I don't really think you're the kind of girl that will never know. Though."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Secretary. And I think your body and my rope make a good team. Yeah. So what? I think."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah. Now there's the test part to see if it actually holds with bamboo. It's hard sometimes to make things not slip. And the best way to test this? Well, just to do. foot on the right one. oh. You can't close your legs, can you? Two? Oh, look at you. Feel the wind pieces for. Oh!"},

{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah. Did you call enough for to come some more? But for now, that's all for today. Oh, So good."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh, you."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Oh! We're, Hi, Katrina. Hello. How are you feeling? Good. That was hot. It felt hot. Super fucking. I do think I am now a fan of being outside more. Because at first I was like, okay, it's outside, it's whatever. But now that's outside and there's random people that we're moving around through the whole thing. That was pretty fucking hot."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah. I actually really enjoyed that element. it was kind of nice. It was? Yeah. People were possibly watching us or were intentionally watching us. That was pretty hot. Yeah. I mean, it's like you always watch us, but, so we started off, in a basic standing position and turned it into a suspension. Then we put you in kind of a predicament."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Tie for the second one. Just kind of had your pelvis set up bridged, I think, is what they call it. Yeah. and then the last one, we just had kind of a basic doggy because you got a phenomenal everything, but we didn't want to not show your ass off. So we did that. what would you say out of the day, if anything?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "What was the most challenging thing we did today? The most challenging. I knew you were going to ask this, and I was trying to think what it would be."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "None of it. And I'm a little undecided. Okay. you know, there are definitely some, Excuse me. got sick on my throat. gosh, I can't I can't decide. What are they? What are they between? just like General, Like the impact. at times, like, kind of get right up on the. Yeah, right up on the edge."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "And forever, it felt like, I felt a little bit more intense than I had previously felt with that kind of play. just whatever my body felt like today. and then also, I guess the suspension was now. So that was definitely. Just exploring those new sensations, I guess. but the suspension and then the nipple stuff."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "My nipples were. I know, and you you went for. No, you went for it. That's a no no, I definitely did not say no, I enjoyed that. It was nice. But I do you also I, I'm very I feel like I'm a big cat when it comes to like kneading into the flesh. I loved that when you kind of pressed back and started almost purring, I was like, oh, I did like minded person here."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "the suspension for starters. I don't wanna go too far from that. First, that was your first suspension? That was. That was wrist and legs. That was it. That's not like the easiest thing for people to just jump into, especially for a first time in the air. Yeah. Not to be like a champ. I enjoyed it. Yeah. For sure."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "This means we got to do this again so we can experiment more stuff. I hope so. what would you say was your favorite part? Favorite part? You got my mind going. I when you pulled on my skin, I love that. the like. Oh, yeah. That felt amazing. What? that bridge position. yeah, the second one."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "everything about that felt amazing. The way the, like, rope, like, interacted with my body, the fingering, everything just felt so good. Yeah, I still got it. it was hot. Dude, it was everything about it. I was the same way. There was a whole lot of things going on everywhere. I was just like, fuck, this is really fucking hot."},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah, and for the record, because I don't know that everyone because they they watch on monitor, they see you on the screen that sometimes it doesn't, they can't tell. You're not the shortest person. No. I mean it's like, I don't know, you can we can we can tell real quick. I want to see the. Can you cross your legs again?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Yeah. Just so you guys can see like that's how little that box is going to take you. Hey, what happened to you? I'm a five, nine, five, ten, five, nine, five, ten. And put your entire body from basically head to toe pinched on that little box was a lot. Yeah, that was hot. Hot. did you feel safe today?"},
{"speaker": "Unknown","text": "Absolutely. Did you feel like at any point anything went too far? No. Would you come back and do it again? Absolutely. You were amazing. Thank you so much. Thank you. Bye. Bye, guys."}
